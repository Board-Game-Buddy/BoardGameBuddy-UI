## Abstract
Board Game Buddy is a full-stack web application designed for board game enthusiasts. Users can personalize their experience by selecting a profile, leading them to a dynamic dashboard featuring carousels of board games. The carousels showcases the user's favorited games as well as a curated selection of random categories. Users can delve into detailed game information by clicking on a game card, navigating to a dedicated details page for that board game. The platform also allows seamless browsing of both user-specific saved games and the entire board game catalog, creating an engaging and immersive experience for board game enthusiasts to discover, save, and explore their favorite titles.
